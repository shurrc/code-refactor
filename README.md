# Code-Refactor


## Description
Code-Refactor is a wepage for Horiseon Social Solution Services. In this project I practiced cleaning up HTML and CSS documents in a logical way that eliminated repeated lines of code. I added semantic tags in pursuit of my goal. I also practiced applying good practices to create accessible code. I eliminated lines of code in order to keep my code dry.
